Phishing Website (Educational Project)
Overview

This project was developed as part of my high school final project to demonstrate how phishing attacks function from a technical and defensive standpoint. The purpose of the project is to provide insight into how credential-harvesting attacks are constructed so they can be recognized, analyzed, and mitigated.

The application simulates a phishing login page using PHP for backend processing. It was created strictly for educational use in a controlled environment and was never deployed publicly or used against real users or services.

Project Description

The website imitates the appearance and behavior of a standard login page in order to demonstrate how phishing attacks rely on visual credibility and user trust rather than complex technical exploits.

When a user submits login credentials, the backend processes the input and forwards the captured data to a Discord webhook, which serves as a demonstration of how attackers might receive stolen information in real time. This mechanism was chosen to illustrate how easily sensitive data can be exfiltrated if users are not cautious and if systems are poorly designed or misused.

All data handling in this project is simulated and used solely for learning purposes.

Technologies Used

HTML & CSS – Frontend layout and styling

PHP – Server-side form handling and request processing

Discord Webhooks – Demonstration of external data transmission

Local testing environment – Used exclusively for development and demonstration

Educational Goals

Through this project, I gained practical understanding of:

The structure and flow of phishing attacks

How backend scripts can collect and transmit user input

The role of social engineering in cybersecurity threats

The importance of secure authentication practices

Ethical considerations when studying offensive security techniques

This project contributed to my foundational knowledge in cybersecurity and reinforced the importance of defensive security and user awareness.

Ethical Disclaimer

This project is provided for educational and demonstrational purposes only.

It must not be used for malicious activity

It must not be deployed on public servers

It must not be used to target real users or services

Phishing is illegal and unethical when used maliciously. The intent of this repository is to promote cybersecurity awareness and defensive learning, not exploitation.

Relevance

Phishing remains one of the most prevalent cyber threats globally. Understanding how such attacks are implemented allows developers and security professionals to better:

Detect phishing attempts

Educate users

Design more secure systems

Reduce social engineering risks
