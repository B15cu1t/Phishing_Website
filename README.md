# Phishing Website  
**Educational Cybersecurity Project**

---

## Overview
This project was developed as part of my **high school final project** to demonstrate how phishing attacks function from a **technical and defensive perspective**.

The goal is to provide insight into how credential-harvesting attacks are constructed so they can be **recognized, analyzed, and mitigated**.  
The project was built and tested **exclusively in a controlled environment**.

---

## Project Description
The application simulates a phishing-style login page to demonstrate how such attacks rely on **visual credibility and user trust**, rather than complex technical exploits.

When login credentials are submitted:
- The backend processes the input using **PHP**
- The captured data is forwarded to a **Discord webhook**
- The webhook serves as a demonstration of real-time data exfiltration

All functionality is simulated for educational purposes only.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML & CSS** – Frontend layout and styling  
- **PHP** – Server-side form handling  
- **Discord Webhooks** – Demonstration of external data transmission  
- **Local testing environment** – Used only for development and demonstration  

---

## Educational Goals
Through this project, I gained practical understanding of:
- How phishing attacks are structured
- Backend handling of user-submitted data
- Social engineering as a cybersecurity threat
- Ethical responsibilities in offensive security research
- The importance of secure authentication design

## Ethical Disclaimer
⚠️ **This project is strictly for educational and demonstrational purposes.**

- It must not be deployed publicly  
- It must not target real users or services  
- It must not be used for malicious activity  

Phishing is illegal and unethical when used maliciously.  
This repository exists solely to promote **cybersecurity awareness and defensive learning**.

---

## Relevance
Phishing remains one of the most common cyber threats worldwide.  
Understanding how these attacks operate helps developers and security professionals:
- Detect phishing attempts
- Educate users
- Design safer systems
- Reduce social engineering risks
